// Complete the class. 
// Here are the instuctions:

// Write a class InchWorm that models an inch worm moving along a 
// horizontal line.
// The inch worm  moves either to the right or left. Initially, the 
// inch worm moves to the right, 
// but it can turn to change its direction. In each move, its position 
// changes by one unit in the current direction. 

// Provide two constructors. 
// One that takes the initial position as an argument 
// and one with no arguments that sets the initial position to 0. 

// You will need two instance variables(both of type int). 
// One to keep track of the position and one to keep track of the direction. 
// You can use 1 to represent moving right and -1 to represent moving left. 

// Constructors:
// public InchWorm()
// public InchWorm (int initialPosition)

// Provide these methods:
// public void turn()
// public void move()
// public int getPosition()

// Sample usage:
// InchWorm worm = new InchWorm (10);
// worm.move(); // Now the position is 11
// worm.turn();
// worm.move(); // Now the position is 10


// For the draft, write the no-argument constructor and provide the 
// instance variables for position and direction.

// The instance variables are:
// 1. position, of type int
// 2. direction, of type int
